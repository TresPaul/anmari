# Anmari

A [hugo](https://gohugo.io) website created for [Anmari van der Westhuizen's](https://anmarivanderwesthuizen.com), (very) roughly based on [Sicily](https://github.com/cristianmarint/sicily-hugo-theme/).


## Using

I have unfortunately not yet wrangled this into a submodule theme that you can easily clone into your themes folder, so if you want to use or adapt this theme, (fork and) clone and replace the content with your own. ([Doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) etc. also do this, so I feel less bad about best practices and whatnot.)


## Credit

A lot of code is adapted from the [Sicily](https://github.com/cristianmarint/sicily-hugo-theme/) theme.
